saimon was a nice memory game for kids back in the 90's,
as a finish project for my ios studies i decided to make a tribute to this game.

my saimon version include a firebase database which support all the data of the players including a high score chart.
this game supports all diffrent iphone screen sizes.

hope you'll enjoy playing this game as much as i enjoyed working and studying from it :)
